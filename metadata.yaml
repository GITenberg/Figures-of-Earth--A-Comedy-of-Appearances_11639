description: "Figures of Earth: A Comedy of Appearances (1921) is a fantasy novel\
  \ or ironic romance by James Branch Cabell, set in the imaginary French province\
  \ of Poictesme during the first half of the 13th century. The book follows the earthly\
  \ career of Dom Manuel the Redeemer from his origins as a swineherd, through his\
  \ elevation to the rank of Count of Poictesme, to his death. It forms the second\
  \ volume of Cabell's gigantic Biography of the Life of Manuel.\nCabell's working\
  \ title for Figures of Earth was initially The Fairy Time, then The Figure or The\
  \ Figures, before the final version emerged. The book was published in February\
  \ 1921, during the legal battle to clear his previous novel, Jurgen, from charges\
  \ of obscenity. He accordingly dedicated Figures of Earth to \"six most gallant\
  \ champions\" who had rallied to Jurgen's defense: Sinclair Lewis, Wilson Follett,\
  \ Louis Untermeyer, H. L. Mencken, Hugh Walpole, and Joseph Hergesheimer. The scandal\
  \ that surrounded Cabell's name at this time may have adversely affected reviews\
  \ of Figures of Earth, which, according to the author, registered \"some disappointment\
  \ over its lack of indecency\"; he himself preferred Figures of Earth to Jurgen.\
  \ In the \"Author's Note\" preceding the novel's 1927 reprint, Cabell observed that\
  \ \"Not many other volumes, I believe, have been burlesqued and cried down in the\
  \ public prints by their own dedicatees\" alluding to the fact that both Untermeyer\
  \ and Mencken had publicly expressed dislike with the novel in comparison with Jurgen.\
  \ A 1925 reissue included illustrations by Frank C. Papé. In Cabell's later years\
  \ Figures of Earth fell, like most of his other works, into comparative neglect,\
  \ but two paperback reissues in 1969 and 1971, with introductions by Lin Carter\
  \ and James Blish respectively, brought it back into circulation.\n From Wikipedia\
